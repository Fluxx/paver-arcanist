# Paver Tasks for Arcanist

Just some simple paver tasks to install and init Arcanist into a projects.  I
m basically adding/changing features as I need them, but feel free to fork/contribute.

## TODO

These are some things I'd like to do eventually:

1. Add tasks for needed packanges (in Homebrew, aptitude, etc)
2. More advanced .arcconfig templating system.
3. Add arc to $PATH, and source the source the `bash-completion` file.
